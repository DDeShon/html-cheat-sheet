    <h1>3 Ways to CSS</h1>
    <p>
      There are three ways to implement CSS. Inline CSS is the method of using
      CSS as element tags, similar to other tags in HTML. This is the worst
      possible way of implementing CSS because it's not scalable and mixes the
      HTML and styling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second method of implementing CSS is Internal styling in the head of
      the page. This is better than inline, because it separates the HTML and
      styling. This method is still not preferred because it lacks scalability,
      only allows the CSS to style the page it's part of and it increases the
      size of the HTML file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third, and preferred method of implementing CSS is using an external
      CSS file. The file is linked in the head of the HTML file and can be used
      in every page of a website. This allows scalability and keeps the styling
      and HTML separate.
    </p>

    <!-- CSS Selectors -->
    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
    <p>
      CSS uses selectors <strong>(element tag, id, class)</strong> to apply
      styling to the HTML elements. The selector (in this case h1) is followed
      by a key:pair list of property:values that are enclosed in open and closed
      curly brackets <strong>({})</strong>. Each set of property and value is
      separated by a property/value separator <strong>(:)</strong> and each line
      ends with a semicolon <strong>(;)</strong>. An example of this is
      <strong> "h1 { color: blue; }"</strong>.
    </p>

    <!-- Colors in CSS -->
    <h1>Colors in CSS</h1>
    <p>
      There are multiple methods to call colors in CSS. The color can be called
      by name <strong>(red)</strong>, by hexadecimal <strong>(#ff0000)</strong>,
      by RGB <strong>(rgb(255,0,0))</strong> or by using hsl
      <strong>(hsl(0,100%,50%))</strong>. All four examples will call the color
      <strong>RED</strong>.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <!-- Fonts -->
    <h1>Fonts</h1>
    <p>
      There are two types of fonts that can be used to modify the font on the
      page. The first type is
      <strong>Web Safe Fonts (arial, times new roman, helvetica)</strong> which
      can be used naturally by just calling the font family using the key:value
      pair, example: <strong>font-family: helvetica;</strong>. The second type
      of fonts are added from an external source, such as google fonts:
      <strong
        ><a href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank"
          >fonts.google.com</a
        > </strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Font size can be changed by using the <strong>font-size</strong> property
      for an element. For example, <strong>font-size: 18px;</strong> will set
      the font size for that element to 18 pixels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Font weight can be changed by using the
      <strong>font-weight</strong> property. The weight can be called using the
      name <strong>(bold)</strong> or by using a value <strong>(700)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a shorthand option for changing the font style:
      <strong
        >(font: normal(weight) 16px(size) Arial, Helvetica,
        sans-serif(family)</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space between lines and letters can be adjusted using the
      <strong>line-height</strong> and
      <strong>letter-spacing</strong> properties, respectively. Line-height will
      increase or decrease the space between rows of text:
      <strong>(line-height:1.5rem)</strong>. Letter-spacing will increase or
      decrease the space between letters and words:
      <strong>(letter-spacing: 1.5rem)</strong>.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-top: 500px"></div>
  </body>
</html>
