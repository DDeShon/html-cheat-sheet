    <h1>3 Ways to CSS</h1>
    <p>
      There are three ways to implement CSS. Inline CSS is the method of using
      CSS as element tags, similar to other tags in HTML. This is the worst
      possible way of implementing CSS because it's not scalable and mixes the
      HTML and styling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second method of implementing CSS is Internal styling in the head of
      the page. This is better than inline, because it separates the HTML and
      styling. This method is still not preferred because it lacks scalability,
      only allows the CSS to style the page it's part of and it increases the
      size of the HTML file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third, and preferred method of implementing CSS is using an external
      CSS file. The file is linked in the head of the HTML file and can be used
      in every page of a website. This allows scalability and keeps the styling
      and HTML separate.
